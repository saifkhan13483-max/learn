Create a modern, responsive full-stack website for an online course titled 'Full-Stack Web Development with Modern Tools and AI Agents.'

The website should include the following features and pages:

Home Page:

A clean, professional hero section introducing the course (title, subtitle, and a call-to-action button: “Start Learning” or “Enroll Now”).

Brief course overview and key outcomes (e.g., 'Learn to build and deploy full-stack apps with AI assistance').

Testimonials or highlights of what learners will achieve.

Course Curriculum Page:

Step-by-step course structure showing each module or lesson.

Each module should include a short description, duration, and key skills learned.

Option to expand/collapse or preview lesson details.

Lesson Page (for each module):

Content area for videos, code snippets, and markdown text.

Navigation buttons (“Previous Lesson,” “Next Lesson”).

A section for downloadable resources (e.g., code files, PDF guides).

AI Prompt Learning Section:

Dedicated page that teaches how to write powerful, accurate prompts for AI tools like Lovable and Replit.

Include interactive examples where users can practice prompt writing.

User Dashboard:

Displays progress tracking, completed modules, and course certificates.

Option to resume learning from the last completed lesson.

Admin Panel (optional):

Add/edit/delete lessons and manage user progress.

Upload videos, markdown lessons, and quizzes.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Next.js preferred), Tailwind CSS for design.

Backend: Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes.

Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing users, lessons, and progress.

AI Integration: API endpoints for Lovable/Replit-style AI prompt assistance.

Deployment:

Fully deployable on Vercel or Render, connected with a MongoDB Atlas or Supabase database.

Include environment variables setup and deployment instructions.

Design Requirements:

Modern, minimal UI with soft shadows and rounded corners.

Use consistent color palette (white, blue, and neutral tones).

Mobile-responsive and optimized for performance.

Goal:
Deliver a complete, error-free, full-stack web application that allows users to learn step-by-step web development and AI prompt engineering, from beginner to advanced levels. The site should be intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate for learners of all skill levels.
